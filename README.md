# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create a simple yet engaging Hangman game, providing users with a fun way to test their word-guessing skills. Through the development process, we aim to enhance our proficiency in Python programming and deepen our understanding of interactive console-based applications.

## Installation

To run the Hangman Game, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository

# Navigate to the project directory
cd hangman-game
