# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create a simple yet engaging Hangman game, providing users with a fun way to test their word-guessing skills. Through the development process, we aim to enhance our proficiency in Python programming and deepen our understanding of interactive console-based applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

cd hangman-game

Run the game:

bash

python hangman.py


## **Usage**

    Run the game using the installation instructions.
    Enter a single alphabetical character to guess a letter.
    The game will provide feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or not.
    Continue guessing until you either complete the word or run out of lives.
